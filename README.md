## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use ES6 modules to split the Javascript code, the Slider into a component like format. 

### Continued development

I would spend some more time on creating cooler animations. 

### Useful resources

- [Article on building a more accessible carousel](https://dev.to/jasonwebb/how-to-build-a-more-accessible-carousel-or-slider-35lp) - This helped me when building the slider with accessibility in mind.
